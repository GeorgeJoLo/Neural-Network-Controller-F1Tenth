This repository contains the code for my Thesis "Control of Aunomonous Vehicles F1Tenth with Deep Reinforcment Learngin".

In the folder "f1tenth_simulator" you can find the modified simulator based on https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_simulator

In the folder f1tenth-rl you can find the training environment for the model, based on https://github.com/MichaelBosello/f1tenth-RL

We used the both repositories as a good starting point and we applied various modification to enhance the capabilities of the model.
